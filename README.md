# About

Still Yet Another Sokoban is a clone of the popular puzzle game Sokoban. It runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and more.

Sokoban was invented in Japan and the original program was written by Hiroyuki Imabayashi. It is copyright (C) 1982 Thinking Rabbit Inc. Japan.

"Sokoban" means "warehouse keeper" in Japanese; the goal of the game is to push all the crates into the designated crate positions without getting stuck. Crates can only be pushed forward.

The levels provided are not my own, they are assembled from various sources. The default 90 levels are public domain.

You can add more sets of levels in the data/sokoban/levels folder. The file must have the .txt extension. See existing sets of levels for examples.

Please do not contact me to assist with solving individual levels.

2.0.2           18 Mar 2018
                Basically same as v2.0.1(d), except on Windows, the game config file ".djgames" lives by default under e.g. "c:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\GraySkyGames\" - this is to make the application lend itself to working as a full installed application under Windows. Previously, on Windows it saved the config file into the current folder (which if you extracted from the binary release zip file, would be in the same extracted folder as the application). If you want to load your settings (e.g. remembered-completed-levels) from v2.0.1, you must manually copy this ".djgames" file into the new AppData-based subfolder.
